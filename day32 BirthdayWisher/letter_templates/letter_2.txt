Hey [NAME],

I would like to wish many happy returns of the day and congratulate you for completing another year on this planet.

I regret that I could not attend your birthday in person so to compensate that I am writing this letter to you conveying my birthday wishes.

believe that you must have planned a great party on this day with amazing cuisine and beautiful eye catching decorations.

Today is the day when you have the freedom to do anything, but whatever you do in future I advise you to choose to do it carefully.

Donâ€™t think that by the arrival of this day you have one year lesser to live but think that you lived one more year filled with rich experiences.

I wish you all the best for your future and may you keep celebrating years of happiness

All my love,
Alan Saji
